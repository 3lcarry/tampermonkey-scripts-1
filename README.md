These are my Tampermonkey scripts. Whee.

## Scripts

### `modern-tribe-central-links.js`

Turns the _Pull Request_ field in Modern Tribe's "Central" issues pages into a link.

### `modern-tribe-github-nav.js`

Adds a consistent navigation bar to the top of GitHub and MT's Central allowing for quick jumping between the sites to oft-viewed sections of each site.

### `modern-tribe-tbd-button.js`

Easily prepare a ticket to move to TBD

### `modern-tribe-uncheck-email-all.js`

Auto-uncheck the "email all" checkbox so I only send an email when I _really_ want to.
